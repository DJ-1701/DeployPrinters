# DeployPrinters
Rewrite of @ozthe2's DeployPrinters powershell script (https://github.com/ozthe2/Powershell/blob/master/Active-Directory/DeployPrinters).

https://fearthepanda.com/powershell/2014/11/18/PowerShell-How-to-speed-up-login-times-using-group-policy-preferences/ stated:

'I will be actively working on this script so that it also works with users in specific OUâ€™s as well as Users being members of security groups. Alternatively, go ahead and make any mods yourself if you cannot be bothered to wait for me.'

So I did. ;)

Additional Features:

-Removes all shared printers before running through the XML (can be turned off by switching RASP to $false).

-Can check to see if a root member of an OU or down a path and act accordingly.

-Checked Nested AD Groups for User and Computer entries.
