# DeployPrinters
Rewrite of @ozthe2's DeployPrinters powershell script (https://github.com/ozthe2/Powershell/blob/master/Active-Directory/DeployPrinters).

https://fearthepanda.com/powershell/2014/11/18/PowerShell-How-to-speed-up-login-times-using-group-policy-preferences/ stated:

'I will be actively working on this script so that it also works with users in specific OUâ€™s as well as Users being members of security groups. Alternatively, go ahead and make any mods yourself if you cannot be bothered to wait for me.'

So I did. ;)

Additional Features:

-Removes all shared printers before running through the XML (can be turned on by switching RASP to $true and off by switching it to $false).<br>
-Can check to see if a root member of an OU or down a path and act accordingly.<br>
-Checks AD Groups (including Nested) of the User and Computer to see if there is a Group match.<br>
-Checks for Computer Name and User Name matches.

## Update:<br>
My good friend and 'Coding Goddess' Katy has also made an excellent script for processing printers in Group Policy, you can check it out here. https://katynicholson.uk/2020/08/powershell-printer-script/
